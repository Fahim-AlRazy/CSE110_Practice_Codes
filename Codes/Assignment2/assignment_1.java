1. Find out which of the following are legal identifiers in Java, and which are not.
Also, explain why the invalid ones are invalid. You can try to define each of these (items
a to k below) as a variable in the Dr java interaction pane and find out.
The first one is done for you as an Example. If you want to define hungry, you have to try
int hungry;
a) hungry b) 2AB c) 312.2 d) MOBILE e) “Ans” f) $30
g) Yes/No h) student-id i) A+3 j) ‘X’ k) return

      int hungry;
//    int 2AB;         <invalid variable name / number cannot be first character>
//    int 312.2;       <invalid variable name / decimal point cannot be included in variable name>
      int MOBILE;
//    int "Ans";       <invalid variable name / coatation mark cannot be used >
      int $30 ; // $-dollar is the only special character that can be used as variable name in java
//    int Yes/No;    <invalid variable name / special character like slash cannot be used>
//    int student-id; <invalid variable name / special character hyfen cannot be used>
//    int A+3;         <invalid variable name / special character + cannot be used>
//    int 'X';              <invalid variable name / single coat cannot be used>
//    int return;       <invalid variable name / reserved keyword cannot be used >
